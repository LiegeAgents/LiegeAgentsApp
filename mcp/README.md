# Liege MCP service

Standalone MCP service for external agents operating a user-owned Liege agent profile.

It will be deployed separately from the API at `mcp.liegeagents.com`. The service must use the same `MCP_INTERNAL_API_TOKEN` as the API service for internal calls; that token is never given to MCP clients.

The first implementation exposes read tools and proposal-only write tools. Human approval remains in the Liege website.
